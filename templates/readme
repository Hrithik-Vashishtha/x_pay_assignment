# User Registration & Profile Picture Storage System

This Flask-based web application enables user registration and stores profile pictures in a local file system or a database. It consists of two versions (`app1.py` and `app2.py`) that handle user registration and profile picture storage differently.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allows users to register by providing their name, email, password, phone number, and profile picture.
- **Profile Picture Storage:** Stores user profile pictures in either a local file system or a database.
- **User Retrieval:** Retrieves user information including profile pictures based on user ID.

## Versions

### App1.py
- **Database:** Uses PostgreSQL for user details and MongoDB for storing profile pictures.
- **Endpoints:**
    - `/add_user` (POST): Registers users and stores their profile pictures.
    - `/get_user/<user_id>` (GET): Retrieves user details and their profile picture by user ID.

### App2.py
- **Database:** Utilizes PostgreSQL for both user details and profile picture storage.
- **Endpoints:**
    - `/add_user` (POST): Registers users and saves their profile pictures to a specified upload folder.
    - `/get_user/<user_id>` (GET): Fetches user details including their profile picture by user ID.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd user-registration-profile-picture
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Database Setup:**
    - Ensure PostgreSQL and MongoDB are installed and running locally.
    - Create databases named `registrations` in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

4. **Run the Application:**
    - For App1:
        ```
        python app1.py
        ```
    - For App2:
        ```
        python app2.py
        ```

## Usage

- Access the application via a web browser or API client like Postman.
- Register users by providing necessary details including a profile picture.
- Retrieve user information using their user ID.

## Note

- **Security:** Storing passwords in plaintext is not recommended for production applications. Consider hashing passwords before storage.
- **Deployment:** For production, ensure to configure security measures, handle exceptions, and use appropriate database setups.
